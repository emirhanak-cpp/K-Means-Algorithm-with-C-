# K-Means-Algorithm-with-C-++
An application that lets you run a K-Means algorithm on a pre-determined table of data, made with C++.
The application can take a table of data from the user and run a K-Means algorithm on it. It also plots the results by using the matplotlib library.
I retrieved this project from my old HDD so it may not work properly.

## How to use:
- Open `main.cpp` with a C++ IDE
- Enter the directory of the data file in the commented area
- Run `main.cpp`
